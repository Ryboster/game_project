# Collisions in pygame

### Rectangles

Rectangle is an additional layer for image surfaces. It allows for changing the origin point on the surface. <br>

Rectangles have 2 core functions:<br>
* Precise positioning of surfaces<br>
* Basic Collisions<br>

The image information is stored in the surface. The position information is stored in the rectangle. You're splitting your image into two different variables which you have to control together.<br>
